  <h1>About Landa Vineyards</h1>

  <p>The Landa family, both Jim and Linda originally from San Francisco and their son Dan, moved to their estate on Chalk Hill Road in 1995. While growing up in San Francisco, a local familyâ€™s wine making process greatly influenced Jim. The aromas of the wine and the friends and family gathering to help with the crush were always memorable.</p>

<p>Today, the Landas enjoy a similar process to their heritage from years past. Family and friends gether every year to harvest and crush the grapes. After the pick is finished, there is time for wine, food and fun.</p>
